# nextbus-api

I'm an experienced Ruby developer, learning Go. My aim is to build this without using AI (unless I get majorly stuck).

Happy to receive feedback on anything

-----------------------

This app is a simple server to show me the next bus coming to the nearest bus stop as the official KMB and CityBus apps in HK show all buses (including buses not running today) and only the next bus is shown not all the buses within the upcoming hour.
